# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on achieving 100% test coverage for the Angular starter template project by creating comprehensive unit tests for all TypeScript files that currently lack spec files. The project currently has 35 TypeScript files with only 4 spec files, leaving 31 files without proper test coverage. This initiative will ensure code quality, maintainability, and reliability through comprehensive testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for all TypeScript files, so that I can ensure code quality and catch bugs early in development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the project THEN the system SHALL identify all 31 TypeScript files missing spec files
2. WHEN creating tests THEN each file SHALL have a corresponding .spec.ts file with 100% line coverage
3. WHEN running tests THEN all tests SHALL pass without errors
4. WHEN generating coverage reports THEN the overall coverage SHALL be 100% for lines, functions, branches, and statements

### Requirement 2: Service Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all services to be thoroughly tested, so that business logic is validated and dependencies are properly mocked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing services THEN all public methods SHALL be tested with various input scenarios
2. WHEN testing services THEN all HTTP calls SHALL be mocked using Angular's HttpClientTestingModule
3. WHEN testing services THEN error handling scenarios SHALL be covered
4. WHEN testing services THEN dependency injection SHALL be properly tested

### Requirement 3: Component Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all components to be tested for both logic and template rendering, so that UI behavior is validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing components THEN component initialization SHALL be verified
2. WHEN testing components THEN input/output properties SHALL be tested
3. WHEN testing components THEN user interactions SHALL be simulated and verified
4. WHEN testing components THEN template rendering SHALL be validated
5. WHEN testing components THEN lifecycle hooks SHALL be tested if implemented

### Requirement 4: State Management Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want NgRx store components (actions, reducers, effects, selectors) to be thoroughly tested, so that state management is reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing actions THEN action creators SHALL return correct action objects
2. WHEN testing reducers THEN state transitions SHALL be verified for all actions
3. WHEN testing effects THEN side effects SHALL be mocked and outcomes verified
4. WHEN testing selectors THEN state selection logic SHALL be validated
5. WHEN testing store THEN initial state SHALL be properly defined

### Requirement 5: Interceptor and Error Handler Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want HTTP interceptors and error handlers to be tested, so that cross-cutting concerns are properly validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing interceptors THEN HTTP request/response modification SHALL be verified
2. WHEN testing interceptors THEN error scenarios SHALL be handled correctly
3. WHEN testing error handlers THEN different error types SHALL be processed appropriately
4. WHEN testing error handlers THEN user notifications SHALL be triggered correctly

### Requirement 6: Utility and Helper Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want utility functions and helper classes to be tested, so that shared functionality is reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing utilities THEN all public functions SHALL be tested with edge cases
2. WHEN testing utilities THEN input validation SHALL be verified
3. WHEN testing utilities THEN return values SHALL match expected outputs
4. WHEN testing abstract classes THEN inheritance behavior SHALL be validated

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Setup Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want application configuration and setup files to be tested, so that the app initialization is validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing app config THEN provider configurations SHALL be verified
2. WHEN testing routes THEN route definitions SHALL be validated
3. WHEN testing meta-reducers THEN store enhancement logic SHALL be tested
4. WHEN testing index files THEN exports SHALL be verified

### Requirement 8: Test Quality Standards

**User Story:** As a developer, I want high-quality tests that follow best practices, so that tests are maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) SHALL be followed
2. WHEN writing tests THEN descriptive test names SHALL be used
3. WHEN writing tests THEN proper mocking strategies SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN writing tests THEN test isolation SHALL be maintained
5. WHEN writing tests THEN async operations SHALL be properly handled
